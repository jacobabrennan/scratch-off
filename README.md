# Scratch-Off
Scratchable Image component for multiple frameworks, currently supporting:
* Vue
* React
## About
Scratch-Off is a component that displays an image covered in a scratchable layer - like a digital scratch ticket! Users can enjoy scratching to reveal images, and your app can respond when the image is fully scratched. The component has options to customize colors or specify an image overlay, and intelligently handles display width / height. Versions are available for both Vue and React.
## Getting Started
### Vue
Scratch-off is not part of any package management system.
To use the component, include the file directly in your project. If you are using ES6 modules then you'll need to import Vue into the module. Otherwise, the component will use the global Vue. You can then use Scratch-Off like a normal Vue component.
```html
<scratch-off
  width="100"
  height="100"
  background="photo.png"
  @finished="dostuff()"
/>
```
### React
Scratch-Off is not part of any package management system.
To use the component, include the file directly in your project and then import the component using ```import ScratchOff from './path_to_file'```. You can then use Scratch-Off like a normal React component.
```html
<ScratchOff
  width="100"
  height="100"
  background="photo.png"
  onfinished={callback}
/>
```

## Documentation
### Props
#### width: Integer (optional)
The width, in pixels, to display the component. Background images will be sized as though the CSS property [```object-fit: contain```](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) were applied, while foreground images will be sized like ```object-fit: fill```. If background and foreground are omitted, then width is mandatory.
#### height: Integer (optional)
The height, in pixels, to display the component. See width for details.
#### background: Url | #hex-color (optional)
The image to be revealed by scratching. If a hex color is specified, a color will be revealed instead. If not specified, a default color (grey) will be used. If width and height are not specified, the element will default to using the size of the background image. By default, the component will crop its shape to the shape of the background image.
#### foreground: Url | #hex-color (optional)
A color or image to be drawn over the background, and then scratched off by the user. If width and height are not specified, and the background isn't an image, then the element will use the size of the foreground image.
#### @finished / onfinished (optional)
The callback to invoke once the user has completed scratching the image.
